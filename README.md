# 📊 Power BI Dashboard for Retail Insights  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project was accomplished **remotely at @Elevvo Pathways** as part of my Data Analytics & BI internship.  

It develops an **interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** using the **Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)**.  
The goal is to analyze retail sales performance, highlight **key KPIs**, and provide actionable insights for business growth.  

The dashboard empowers stakeholders to:  
- Monitor **total revenue, profit, and order trends**  
- Identify **top-performing products and categories**  
- Evaluate **sales performance by region, segment, and shipping mode**  
- Explore data interactively with **filters, slicers, and custom visuals**
